# SmartTables

Shows two simple techniques for modern UITableViews

## Computation of row height via auto-layout

The table view controller keeps a extra 'metrics' cell property that is used to populate and layout cells for height calculation purposes.

## View controllers as cell prototypes

Use of UIViewControllers in table view cells and runtime generation of cell classes for specific view controllers

## Requirements

Project uses Xcode 5b3 (specifically the nibs) - but the techniques used work fine on iOS 5.
