# SmartTables

Shows two simple techniques for modern UITableViews

The table view controller keeps a extra 'metrics' cell property that is used to populate and layout cells for height calculation purposes.

## View controllers as cell prototypes

Use of UIViewControllers in table view cells and runtime generation of cell classes for specific view controllers
